# k8s-tekton-demo
test

This repository has been created to with the sole purpose of demo-ing [Tekton](https://tekton.dev)

This repository has three branches

- master

    * Files required to build Tekton Pipeline(s) on top of a Kubernetes cluster created using [k3d](https://github.com/rancher/k3d)

- docker

    * `Dockerfile` to build an Alpine based image with `terraform`

- terraform

    * A super basic `terraform` code

**NOTE**: In production or real life scenarios, please break these into individual repositories with a _good_ branching strategy. I will leave it up to you or your organization's practices to decide what _good_ looks like. :)
